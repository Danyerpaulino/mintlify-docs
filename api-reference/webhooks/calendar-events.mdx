# Calendar Event Webhooks

The Klen AI API can send webhook notifications for various calendar events, allowing you to integrate with external systems and keep them in sync with your Klen AI calendar.

## Available Event Types

When configuring a webhook endpoint, you can subscribe to the following calendar event types:

| Event Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `calendar.created` | A calendar event has been created |
| `calendar.updated` | A calendar event has been updated |
| `calendar.cancelled` | A calendar event has been cancelled |
| `calendar.completed` | A calendar event has been completed |
| `calendar.reminder` | A reminder for a calendar event has been sent |

## Webhook Payload

When a calendar event occurs, the webhook will receive a payload with the following structure:

```json
{
  "event_type": "calendar.created",
  "calendar_event": {
    "id": 123,
    "uuid": "f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479",

## Event-Specific Payload Differences

Depending on the event type, the payload may contain additional information.

### calendar.updated

For `calendar.updated` events, the payload may include information about what was changed:

```json
{
  "event_type": "calendar.updated",
  "calendar_event": {
    // Standard event fields
    ...
    // Additional fields for updates
    "time_changed": true,
    "previous_start": "2025-05-01T13:00:00.000Z",
    "previous_end": "2025-05-01T14:00:00.000Z"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-05-01T10:15:30.000Z"
}
```

### calendar.cancelled

For `calendar.cancelled` events, the payload may include a cancellation reason:

```json
{
  "event_type": "calendar.cancelled",
  "calendar_event": {
    // Standard event fields
    ...
    // Additional fields for cancellations
    "reason": "Client requested to reschedule"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-05-01T10:15:30.000Z"
}
```

## Webhook Security

All webhook requests include a signature in the `X-Klen-Signature` header for verification. See the [Webhook Security](/api-reference/webhooks/overview#webhook-security) documentation for details on how to verify webhook signatures.

## Configuring Webhooks

To configure a webhook for calendar events:

1. Go to the [Webhooks page](https://app.klen.ai/settings/webhooks) in the Klen AI dashboard
2. Click "Create new webhook"
3. Enter a name and URL for your webhook
4. Select the calendar event types you want to subscribe to
5. Click "Create webhook"

Alternatively, you can use the [Create Webhook API endpoint](/api-reference/webhooks/create-webhook) to programmatically create webhook endpoints.

## Testing Webhooks

You can test your webhook integration by creating, updating, or cancelling calendar events through the Klen AI dashboard or API.
