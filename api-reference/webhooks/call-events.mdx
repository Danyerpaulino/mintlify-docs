# Call Events

This page details the webhook events related to calls and the payload structure for each event type.

## Event Types

| Event Type | Description | Trigger |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| `call.started` | Call has started | Triggered when a call connects |
| `call.ended` | Call has ended | Triggered when a call is completed normally |
| `call.failed` | Call failed to connect | Triggered when a call fails to connect |
| `call.transcript` | Call transcript is available | Triggered when a transcript is generated |

## Common Payload Structure

All call-related webhook events share a common payload structure, with some event-specific fields:

```json
{
  "event_type": "call.ended",                   // The type of event
  "call": {
    "id": 123,                                  // Database ID
    "klen_call_id": "call_abc123",              // Call ID from klen
    "agent_id": 456,                            // Agent ID
    "agent_name": "Customer Support",           // Agent name
    "status": "completed",                      // Call status
    "type": "inbound",                          // Call type (inbound/outbound)
    "phone_number": "+15551234567",             // Client phone number
    "started_at": "2025-04-23T14:30:45Z",       // Call start time
    "ended_at": "2025-04-23T14:35:12Z",         // Call end time
    "duration_seconds": 267                     // Call duration in seconds
    // Additional event-specific fields...
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-04-23T14:35:15Z"           // Webhook generation timestamp
}
```

## Event-Specific Payload Details

## Contact Information

If the call is associated with a contact in your Klen AI account, the contact information is included in the payload:

```json
{
  "event_type": "call.ended",
  "call": {
    // Common fields...
    "contact": {
      "id": 789,
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com"
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-04-23T14:35:15Z"
}
```

## Workflow Example

Here's a typical workflow for call events:

1. Receive `call.started` when a call connects
2. Receive `call.ended` when the call completes
3. Receive `call.transcript` when the transcript is ready
4. Receive `call.summary` when the AI summary is generated
5. Receive `call.recording` when the audio recording is available

## Handling Multiple Subscriptions

If you have multiple webhook endpoints subscribed to the same events, each endpoint will receive a copy of the webhook. This allows you to process events in different systems or applications.

## Security Recommendations

When processing call events:

1. Always verify the webhook signature
2. Implement idempotency to handle potential duplicate deliveries
3. Securely store sensitive information like phone numbers and transcripts
4. Use HTTPS for your webhook endpoints

## Testing Call Events

To test call events, you can:

1. Make a test call using the Klen AI dashboard
2. Use a webhook testing tool (like [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site))
3. Check the webhook delivery logs in your Klen AI dashboard

## Handling Large Payloads

For lengthy transcripts or large call summaries, we may include a URL to download the content instead of including it directly in the webhook payload. In these cases, you'll see a `transcript_url` or similar field with a pre-signed URL to download the content.
