# Authentication

The Klen AI API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys from your Klen AI dashboard.

## API Keys

All API requests must include an API key in one of the following ways:

### Bearer Token (Recommended)

Send your API key as a Bearer token in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer klen_abcdef123456789
```

### API Key Header

Alternatively, you can use the X-API-Key header:

```bash
X-API-Key: klen_abcdef123456789
```

### Query Parameter

For testing or simple applications, you can include your API key as a query parameter:

```
GET https://api.klen.ai/api/v1/calls?api_key=klen_abcdef123456789
```

> **Security Note**: Using query parameters is less secure as API keys may be logged in server access logs. Use the header methods for production applications.

## Creating API Keys

To create a new API key:

1. Log in to your [Klen AI dashboard](https://app.klen.ai)
2. Navigate to API > API Keys
3. Click "Create New API Key"
4. Give your key a name and select the appropriate permissions
5. Click "Create Key"

Make sure to copy and store your API key securely. For security reasons, you won't be able to view the full key again after creation.

## API Key Permissions

When creating an API key, you can grant specific permissions:

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `can_read_calls` | Allows retrieving call information |
| `can_initiate_calls` | Allows initiating new calls |
| `can_read_agents` | Allows retrieving agent information |
| `can_read_contacts` | Allows retrieving contact information |
| `can_read_calendar` | Allows retrieving calendar events and availability |
| `can_write_calendar` | Allows creating, updating, and canceling calendar events |


## Rate Limiting

API keys have rate limits applied:

- `requests_per_minute_limit`: Maximum number of API requests per minute (default: 60)
- `calls_per_day_limit`: Maximum number of calls that can be initiated per day (default: 100)
- `calendar_events_per_day_limit`: Maximum number of calendar events that can be created per day (default: 50)

If you exceed these limits, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

## Key Security

Keep your API keys secure:

- Never share your API keys in publicly accessible areas like GitHub, client-side code, or exposed in your application.
- Use different API keys for different environments (development, staging, production).
- Periodically rotate your API keys to minimize the impact of potential leaks.

## Revoking API Keys

To revoke an API key:

1. Log in to your [Klen AI dashboard](https://app.klen.ai)
2. Navigate to API > API Keys
3. Click the "Revoke" button next to the key you want to revoke

Note that revoking a key is immediate and permanent. Any applications using the revoked key will lose access to the API.

## Error Responses

If you encounter authentication errors, you may see the following responses:

| Status Code | Error Code | Description |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| 401 | `authentication_required` | No API key was provided |
| 401 | `invalid_key` | The API key is invalid or inactive |
| 403 | `permission_denied` | The API key doesn't have the required permission |
| 429 | `rate_limit_exceeded` | Rate limit has been exceeded |
