# Calendar API

The Calendar API allows you to integrate with Klen AI's calendar functionality, enabling you to:

- Retrieve calendar events
- Create, update, and cancel events
- Check availability for scheduling
- Integrate with AI agents for automated scheduling

## Base URL

All Calendar API endpoints are available under the base URL:

```
https://api.klen.ai/api/v1/calendar
```

## Authentication

All Calendar API requests require authentication using an API key. See the [Authentication](/api-reference/authentication) section for more details.

## Calendar API Permissions

Your API key must have the following permissions to use the Calendar API:

- `can_read_calendar` - Required for read operations (GET requests)
- `can_write_calendar` - Required for write operations (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE requests)

## Rate Limits

Each API key has a limit on the number of calendar events that can be created per day, defined by the `calendar_events_per_day_limit` field (default: 50).

## Calendar Event Types

Calendar events can be of the following types:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `meeting` | A general meeting |
| `appointment` | A scheduled appointment |
| `busy` | A busy/unavailable time slot |
| `voice_call` | A voice call |
| `video_call` | A video call |

## Calendar Event Statuses

Calendar events can have the following statuses:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `scheduled` | The event is scheduled but not yet confirmed |
| `confirmed` | The event is confirmed |
| `cancelled` | The event has been cancelled |
| `completed` | The event has been completed |
| `no_show` | The customer did not show up for the event |

## Webhook Integration

The Calendar API integrates with Klen AI's webhook system, allowing you to receive notifications when calendar events are created, updated, cancelled, or completed.

The following webhook event types are available for calendar events:

| Event Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `calendar.created` | A calendar event has been created |
| `calendar.updated` | A calendar event has been updated |
| `calendar.cancelled` | A calendar event has been cancelled |
| `calendar.completed` | A calendar event has been completed |
| `calendar.reminder` | A reminder for a calendar event has been sent |

See the [Webhooks](/api-reference/webhooks/overview) section for more details on how to set up and use webhooks.

## External Calendar Integration

Calendar events can be synchronized with external calendar services such as:

- Google Calendar
- Microsoft Outlook
- GoHighLevel

When an event is created, updated, or cancelled through the API, it can be automatically synchronized with connected external calendars if the `sync_external_calendars` parameter is set to `true`.
