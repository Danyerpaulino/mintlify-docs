# Development Guide

This guide provides advanced tips, best practices, and examples for developers working with the Klen AI API. Use this information to build robust, scalable integrations with our platform.

## API Architecture

The Klen AI API is a RESTful API that uses standard HTTP methods and returns JSON responses. The base URL for all API requests is:

```
https://api.klen.ai/api/v1
```

Our API follows these conventions:

- `GET` requests for retrieving resources
- `POST` requests for creating resources
- `PUT`/`PATCH` requests for updating resources
- `DELETE` requests for deleting resources (when applicable)

## Error Handling

The API returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages to help you troubleshoot issues:

```json
{
  "error": "error_code",
  "message": "Human-readable error message"
}
```

Common error codes include:

| Status Code | Error Code | Description |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| 400 | `validation_error` | Invalid input parameters |
| 401 | `authentication_required` | No API key provided |
| 401 | `invalid_key` | Invalid or inactive API key |
| 403 | `permission_denied` | API key lacks required permission |
| 404 | `not_found` | Requested resource not found |
| 429 | `rate_limit_exceeded` | Rate limit exceeded |
| 500 | `server_error` | Internal server error |

For robust error handling, implement retry logic with exponential backoff for 5xx errors and 429 rate limit errors.

## Pagination

List endpoints support pagination through the `page` and `limit` query parameters:

```
GET /api/v1/calls?page=2&limit=25
```

Pagination responses include metadata to help you navigate the results:

```json
{
  "count": 157,     // Total number of items
  "page": 2,        // Current page
  "limit": 25,      // Items per page
  "pages": 7,       // Total number of pages
  "calls": [...]    // Results for this page
}
```

For large datasets, we recommend implementing cursor-based pagination by storing the ID of the last item received and using it to fetch the next page.

## Rate Limiting

Our API implements rate limiting to ensure the stability of the service. Rate limits are enforced on a per-API-key basis.

When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` status code with a `Retry-After` header indicating when you can make your next request.

```
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
Content-Type: application/json
Retry-After: 30

{
  "error": "rate_limit_exceeded",
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Please try again after 30 seconds."
}
```

Implement proper handling of rate limit responses by respecting the `Retry-After` header and implementing exponential backoff strategies.

## Best Practices

### Security

1. **Store API Keys Securely**: Never hardcode API keys in your source code or expose them in client-side JavaScript.
2. **Use Environment Variables**: Store your API keys in environment variables or a secure key management system.
3. **Implement IP Allowlisting**: Use the Klen AI dashboard to restrict access to your API keys from specific IP addresses.
4. **Create Scoped Keys**: Create API keys with the minimum required permissions for each use case.

### Performance

1. **Optimize Batch Operations**: Use batch endpoints where available instead of making many individual requests.
2. **Implement Caching**: Cache responses for resources that don't change frequently.
3. **Use Compression**: Enable gzip compression for API requests and responses to reduce bandwidth usage.
4. **Filter Results**: Use query parameters to filter results on the server side rather than retrieving all data and filtering client-side.

### Webhooks

1. **Verify Webhook Signatures**: Always verify the signature of incoming webhook requests using the secret provided when creating the webhook.
2. **Implement Idempotency**: Handle webhook events idempotently to avoid duplicate processing.
3. **Acknowledge Quickly**: Respond to webhook requests with a 2xx status code as quickly as possible, then process the event asynchronously.

## Working with Agents

When creating or updating AI agents, you can customize various aspects of their behavior:

### Agent Persona

Provide detailed instructions to shape your agent's personality, tone, and behavior:

```json
{
  "name": "Customer Support Agent",
  "model_instructions": "You are a friendly and helpful customer support agent for a software company. Your goal is to help customers troubleshoot technical issues and answer questions about our products. Be patient, empathetic, and technically accurate. If you don't know the answer to a specific question, politely acknowledge this and offer to connect the customer with a human agent."
}
```

### Context Variables

Use context variables to provide dynamic information to your agents during calls:

```json
{
  "variables": {
    "customer_name": "John Doe",
    "last_purchase": "Premium Plan (3 months ago)",
    "open_tickets": [
      {
        "id": "T-12345",
        "subject": "Integration issue with API",
        "status": "In Progress"
      }
    ],
    "subscription_status": "Active",
    "renewal_date": "2025-07-15"
  }
}
```

Variables can be referenced in the agent's instructions using `{{variable_name}}` syntax.

## Testing

We provide a sandbox environment for testing your integration without making real phone calls:

```
https://api-sandbox.klen.ai/api/v1
```

In the sandbox environment:
- No real calls are made
- No charges are incurred
- Test data is automatically generated
- API responses mimic production behavior

To use the sandbox, simply replace the base URL in your API requests.

## Implementing Webhooks

### Receiving Webhooks

Here's an example of how to receive and verify webhook events using Node.js and Express:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const crypto = require('crypto');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json());

const WEBHOOK_SECRET = process.env.KLEN_WEBHOOK_SECRET;

app.post('/webhooks/klen', (req, res) => {
  const signature = req.headers['x-klen-signature'];
  const body = JSON.stringify(req.body);
  
  // Verify signature
  const expectedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', WEBHOOK_SECRET)
    .update(body)
    .digest('hex');
    
  if (signature !== expectedSignature) {
    return res.status(401).send('Invalid signature');
  }
  
  // Process the webhook event
  const event = req.body;
  console.log(`Received ${event.event_type} event`);
  
  // Process based on event type
  switch (event.event_type) {
    case 'call.started':
      // Handle call started
      break;
    case 'call.ended':
      // Handle call ended
      break;
    case 'call.transcript':
      // Handle call transcript
      break;
    // Handle other event types...
  }
  
  // Acknowledge receipt
  res.status(200).send('Webhook received');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Webhook server running on port 3000');
});
```

### Webhook Event Types

Refer to our [Webhook Events documentation](/api-reference/webhooks/overview) for a complete list of available webhook events and their payloads.
